---

#### **Definition:**
- The **select operation** chooses a subset of rows from a table based on a **predicate (condition)**.
- It is a **horizontal subset** of the table since it filters rows, not columns.

**General Form:**
```
œÉ<condition>(Relation)
```

---

#### **Example:**
Consider a relation **STUDENT**:

| RollNo | Name   | Dept     | Marks |
|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| 101    | Asha   | CS       | 85    |
| 102    | Ravi   | IT       | 70    |
| 103    | Meena  | CS       | 90    |
| 104    | Akash  | EC       | 65    |

---

#### **Query 1:**  
Find all students from the **CS department**.

   œÉc1(œÉc2(R)) = œÉc2(œÉc1(R))
   ```
   - The order of applying selection conditions does not matter.

2. **Associativity with AND condition:**
   ```
   œÉc1 ‚àß c2(R) = œÉc1(œÉc2(R))
   ```

3. **Idempotent Property:**
   ```
   œÉc(œÉc(R)) = œÉc(R)
   ```

4. **No change to schema:**
   - The structure (columns) of the relation remains the same; only tuples are filtered.

---

#### **Diagrammatic Representation:**
```
Input Relation (R)
       ‚Üì

3. **Cost Estimation**
   - DBMS estimates cost for each plan based on:
     - Table size
     - Index availability
     - Join methods
     - Disk access time
4. **Plan Selection**
   - Plan with **lowest estimated cost** is chosen for execution.

---

#### **Example**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE CustomerID = 10;
```
- Optimizer may choose:
  - **Index scan** if index exists.
  - **Full table scan** otherwise.
- The plan with lower estimated cost is selected.

---

#### **Advantages**
- Increases query performance.
- Adapts dynamically to data statistics.
- Minimizes resource consumption.

---

**Conclusion:**  
Cost-Based Optimization ensures **efficient query execution** by using statistical models to choose the **least expensive** plan among alternatives.

### **1. Describe XML Briefly.**

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language designed primarily to transport and store data, not to display it (unlike HTML). It is widely used for data exchange between diverse systems due to its self-describing nature and platform independence.  

**Key Features:**
- **Extensible:** Unlike HTML, which uses a fixed set of tags, XML allows users to define their own tags (e.g., `<student>`, `<course>`).
- **Hierarchical Data Structure:** Data is organized in a tree-like structure with nested elements.
- **Self-Describing:** Each tag clearly describes the data it encloses, making the document human- and machine-readable.
- **Validation:** Documents can be validated using **DTD (Document Type Definition)** or **XML Schema**, ensuring structure and integrity.

### **2. Discuss ER Modelling Concepts and Notations**

**Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling** is a high-level conceptual data modeling approach that represents the logical structure of a database.

**Core Concepts:**
1. **Entity Set:** Collection of similar objects (e.g., Students, Employees).  
   *Notation:* Rectangle.  
2. **Attributes:** Properties describing entities (e.g., Name, Age).  
   *Notation:* Oval. Key attributes are underlined.  
3. **Relationship Set:** Association among entities (e.g., WORKS_FOR).  
   *Notation:* Diamond.

**Constraints and Notations:**
- **Cardinality Ratios:** Indicate the number of entities involved (1:1, 1:N, M:N).  
- **Participation Constraints:**  
  - Total (double line)  
  - Partial (single line)  
- **Weak Entity Set:** Depends on a strong entity. Represented by **double rectangles** and **double diamonds**.
