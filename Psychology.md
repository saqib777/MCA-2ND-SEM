**1.2 Introduction**

All kinds of situations ultimately lead to various kinds of stress and 
strain in the minds of an individual. Individuals whether they are doing well or finding some 
problems in their life in handling situations go to seek help. The professionals in this field 
who are expert in understanding the human behaviour try to help the people who do face 
problems in handling the situations. They help them to make better adjustment and become 
capable to deal with the various challenges of life.   

Psychology, as a profession, is the scientific study of human behavior and mental processes applied to improve individual and collective well-being. Professional psychologists use research-based knowledge to understand how people think, feel, and act, and they apply this understanding in various settings such as healthcare, education, industry, and community services.

Psychology as a career offers diverse specializations—including clinical psychology, counseling, educational, industrial-organizational, forensic, and health psychology—each addressing different aspects of human experience. Professionals in the field engage in assessment, diagnosis, therapy, research, and consultation, often guided by ethical standards that emphasize confidentiality, competence, and respect for human rights.

Modern psychologists are not only therapists or counselors but also researchers, educators, consultants, and policy advisors, contributing to mental health awareness and social development. With the growing recognition of mental health’s importance, psychology has evolved into a dynamic, multidisciplinary profession that bridges science and human welfare, promoting psychological resilience and a better quality of life.

Psychology as a profession holds vital importance in modern society because it applies scientific understanding of human behavior and mental processes to promote individual and collective well-being. Unlike theoretical psychology, which focuses on research and understanding, the professional side of psychology is applied—it translates knowledge into practical interventions that improve mental health, enhance performance, resolve conflicts, and guide social development.

Identifying causes of maladaptive behaviors or emotional distress.

Predicting human reactions in personal, educational, or organizational settings.

Designing interventions that modify behavior and promote adaptive functioning.

Professionally, this makes psychologists essential in diagnosis, therapy, and prevention of mental health issues.

Psychology professionals—clinical, counseling, and health psychologists—play a direct role in mental health promotion:

They assess and treat conditions such as anxiety, depression, trauma, or stress.
