CMP is software for managing and monitoring multi-cloud/hybrid environments.
• Purpose: Centralized management, consistency, and compliance.
• Functions: Cost control, policy enforcement, and self-service provisioning.

---
12️⃣ What is Cloud Orchestration? (Q17)
Cloud orchestration automates and coordinates multiple automated tasks into workflows.
• Links tasks like VM creation, database setup, and networking.
• Goal: Streamline operations and ensure consistency across resources.
