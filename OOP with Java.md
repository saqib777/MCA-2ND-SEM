### Q1. What are Variables?

**Answer:**
A **variable** in Java is a **named memory location** that stores data which can be used and modified during program execution.  
Every variable in Java has a **data type**, which determines the kind of data it can hold, such as integers, characters, or strings.  

Java variables must be declared before use and follow strict **type safety** rules.  
Syntax:  
```java
int age = 25;
String name = "Saqib";
```

**Types of Variables in Java:**
1. **Local Variables:** Declared inside methods or blocks, accessible only within them.  
2. **Instance Variables:** Declared inside a class but outside methods; associated with object instances.  
3. **Static Variables:** Declared using the `static` keyword; shared among all objects of a class.

Variables are essential for storing data, performing calculations, and controlling program logic.



### Q2. Define OOPs concept in Java

**Answer:**

OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System) in Java is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects** that contain data and methods. It helps in organizing software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.  

The main **principles of OOPs** in Java are:  

1. **Encapsulation:**  
   Wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) together into a single unit called a class. It hides the internal details and provides controlled access using getters and setters.

2. **Inheritance:**  
   The process by which one class (child or subclass) can acquire the properties and behaviors of another class (parent or superclass). It promotes code reuse.

3. **Polymorphism:**  
   The ability of a single function, method, or operator to behave differently based on context. In Java, it is achieved through method overloading and method overriding.

4. **Abstraction:**  
   Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It is achieved using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.

**In short:**  
OOPs in Java enables modular, reusable, and maintainable code by modeling real-world entities as objects.

### Q3. What are Arrays?

**Answer:**
An **array** in Java is a **data structure** that allows storing multiple elements of the **same data type** in a single variable.  
Instead of declaring multiple variables for each element, an array stores all elements in a **contiguous memory location** and provides **indexed access**, where the first element starts at index 0.  

Arrays can be:
- **Single-dimensional:** A simple list of elements (e.g., `int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};`)
- **Multi-dimensional:** Arrays of arrays, like matrices (e.g., `int[][] matrix = new int[3][3];`)

Arrays are efficient for **iterating, sorting, and managing data collections** of fixed size.  
However, their size cannot be changed once created, which is why dynamic structures like **ArrayList** are often used.

### Q4. Define an Exception

**Answer:**
An **exception** in Java is an **event or error** that occurs during the execution of a program, interrupting its normal flow.  
Java provides a robust **exception-handling mechanism** to manage runtime errors, allowing the program to continue instead of crashing.  

Exceptions are objects derived from the `Throwable` class and are categorized into:
- **Checked Exceptions:** Checked at compile time (e.g., `IOException`, `SQLException`).
- **Unchecked Exceptions:** Occur at runtime (e.g., `NullPointerException`, `ArithmeticException`).

Java handles exceptions using **try**, **catch**, **throw**, **throws**, and **finally** blocks.  
This helps in writing **secure, reliable, and maintainable** programs by managing unexpected situations gracefully.

### Q5. What is Pluggable Look and Feel?

**Answer:**
The **Pluggable Look and Feel (PLAF)** in Java allows Swing applications to **change their graphical appearance** dynamically without altering the program’s logic.  
It provides a mechanism to separate the **user interface design** from the **application functionality**.  

Java Swing supports multiple built-in look and feels such as:
- **Metal** (default Java look)
- **Nimbus**
- **Windows**
- **Motif**

Developers can also create **custom look and feel** classes.  
It is implemented using the `UIManager.setLookAndFeel()` method, allowing applications to appear **native to the operating system** or maintain a consistent look across platforms.  

Example:  
```java
UIManager.setLookAndFeel("javax.swing.plaf.nimbus.NimbusLookAndFeel");
```

### Q6. Name the various Input Streams available in Java.

**Answer:**
Java provides the **InputStream** class as the **base class** for all byte-oriented input operations.  
Input streams are used to **read data** from various sources such as files, memory, or network connections, **one byte at a time**.  

Some important types of Input Streams are:

1. **FileInputStream:** Used to read data from files on the disk.  
2. **ByteArrayInputStream:** Reads data from an array of bytes in memory.  
3. **BufferedInputStream:** Adds buffering to input streams for efficient reading of large data.  
4. **DataInputStream:** Allows reading Java primitive data types (int, double, etc.) from an input stream.  
5. **ObjectInputStream:** Used to read objects that were previously serialized and saved to a stream.  
6. **PipedInputStream:** Connects with a `PipedOutputStream` to allow inter-thread communication.

Together, these classes form a powerful system for **handling input in different forms**, providing flexibility and performance.

---

### Q7. Name the various Input Streams available in Java.

**Answer:**
Java’s **InputStream** class (in `java.io` package) is the **superclass** of all classes used for reading byte-oriented data.  
Input streams are used to **read data from sources** like files, arrays, or network connections.  

Common **types of InputStreams** include:

1. **FileInputStream:** Reads data from a file on disk.  
2. **ByteArrayInputStream:** Reads data from a byte array stored in memory.  
3. **BufferedInputStream:** Provides buffering for efficient reading of data.  
4. **DataInputStream:** Reads primitive data types (int, float, etc.) from an input stream.  
5. **ObjectInputStream:** Reads objects that have been serialized.  
6. **PipedInputStream:** Used for communication between threads via connected streams.

These streams make input operations in Java **efficient, structured, and flexible**.

---

### Q8. Discuss about Garbage Collection.

**Answer:**
**Garbage Collection (GC)** in Java is an automatic process that **reclaims memory** used by objects that are no longer referenced in a program.  
It helps manage memory efficiently by freeing unused objects from the **heap memory**, thus preventing memory leaks.  

Java’s garbage collector runs in the background and removes unreferenced objects automatically, eliminating the need for manual memory management like in C/C++.  

**Benefits:**
- Reduces memory leaks.  
- Improves application performance and stability.  
- Simplifies programming by handling memory cleanup automatically.

The **`System.gc()`** method can be used to suggest garbage collection, but the **JVM decides when to execute** it.  
Garbage collection makes Java a more **robust and secure** language for memory management.

---

### Q9. What is the function of FileOutputStream?

**Answer:**
The **FileOutputStream** class in Java is used to **write data to files** in the form of bytes.  
It belongs to the `java.io` package and is mainly used for **writing raw binary data**, such as images, audio files, or executable data.  

Syntax Example:
```java
FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");
fout.write(65);  // writes the character 'A'
fout.close();
```

**Key Functions:**
- Creates or opens a file for writing.  
- Writes data byte by byte using the `write()` method.  
- Supports file overwriting or appending modes.  

It is commonly used with `BufferedOutputStream` for more efficient file writing.

---

### Q10. Define an Exception.

**Answer:**
An **exception** in Java is an **unexpected event** that occurs during the execution of a program, disrupting its normal flow.  
It represents an **error condition** that can be handled using Java’s **exception handling mechanism**.  

Exceptions are categorized into:
1. **Checked Exceptions:** Handled at compile time (e.g., `IOException`, `SQLException`).  
2. **Unchecked Exceptions:** Occur at runtime (e.g., `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`).  
3. **Errors:** Serious problems not handled by applications (e.g., `OutOfMemoryError`).

Exception handling uses keywords like `try`, `catch`, `throw`, `throws`, and `finally` to manage errors.  
This ensures that the program continues executing smoothly even when errors occur.

---

### Q11. What is AWT?

**Answer:**
**AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)** is a part of Java’s standard library (`java.awt` package) used to create **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** applications.  
It provides a set of **classes and methods** for building windows, buttons, text fields, menus, and other graphical components.  

AWT components are **platform-dependent**, meaning they rely on the **native system’s GUI resources**.  
It follows a **hierarchical event-driven model**, where user actions (like clicks or typing) generate events handled by listeners.

**Main Components of AWT:**
- **Container:** Holds components (e.g., `Frame`, `Panel`).
- **Components:** UI elements (e.g., `Button`, `Label`, `TextField`).
- **Layout Managers:** Control the positioning of components (`FlowLayout`, `BorderLayout`, `GridLayout`).
- **Event Handling:** Uses event classes and listeners for user interaction.

**Example:**
```java
Frame f = new Frame("AWT Example");
Button b = new Button("Click Me");
f.add(b);
f.setSize(300, 200);
f.setVisible(true);
```

AWT is the foundation for advanced frameworks like **Swing** and **JavaFX**, making it an essential part of Java’s GUI programming.

### Q12. Write a note on Fundamentals of Threads.

**Answer:**
A **thread** in Java is the **smallest unit of a process** that can execute independently.  
Multithreading allows multiple parts of a program to run **concurrently**, improving performance and responsiveness.  

Java supports multithreading through the **`Thread` class** and the **`Runnable` interface** in the `java.lang` package.

**Thread Life Cycle:**
1. **New:** Thread is created but not yet started.  
2. **Runnable:** Ready to run and waiting for CPU scheduling.  
3. **Running:** Currently executing.  
4. **Blocked/Waiting:** Waiting for a resource or signal.  
5. **Terminated:** Execution completed.

**Creating a Thread:**
- By extending the `Thread` class and overriding the `run()` method.
- By implementing the `Runnable` interface.

**Example:**
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}
MyThread t = new MyThread();
t.start();
```

Threads are used in applications like gaming, servers, and concurrent data processing, providing **efficiency and better CPU utilization**.

---

### Q13. Define OOP’s Concept.

**Answer:**
**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java is a design philosophy centered around **objects**—entities that combine data and behavior.  
It allows programmers to structure software in a modular, reusable, and maintainable way.  

Java implements OOP using **classes** and **objects**, where a class defines the blueprint, and objects are instances of that class.

**Core Principles of OOP:**
1. **Encapsulation:**  
   Binding data and methods within a single unit (class), hiding implementation details using access modifiers like `private`, `public`, and `protected`.
2. **Inheritance:**  
   Enables one class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another, promoting code reusability.
3. **Polymorphism:**  
   Allows one interface or method to behave differently based on context, achieved via **method overloading** and **method overriding**.
4. **Abstraction:**  
   Hides unnecessary implementation details and exposes only essential features, using **abstract classes** or **interfaces**.

OOP provides a structured approach to software design, enhancing **scalability, readability, and maintenance**.

### Q14. What are Variables?

**Answer:**
A **variable** in Java is a **named memory location** used to store data that can change during program execution.  
Each variable has a **type**, which defines the kind of data it can hold, and a **scope**, determining its accessibility.  

**Declaration Example:**
```java
int age = 25;
String name = "Saqib";
```

**Types of Variables in Java:**
1. **Local Variables:** Declared inside methods or blocks; accessible only within them.  
2. **Instance Variables:** Declared in a class but outside methods; each object has its own copy.  
3. **Static Variables:** Declared with the `static` keyword; shared by all objects of a class.  

Variables are the foundation of every Java program as they help in storing data, performing computations, and controlling logic.

---

### Q15. What are Arrays?

**Answer:**
An **array** in Java is a **collection of elements of the same data type**, stored in **contiguous memory locations**.  
It allows you to store and access multiple values using a **single variable name** with **index-based access** (starting from 0).  

**Example:**
```java
int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
System.out.println(numbers[2]); // Output: 30
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- Fixed in size (cannot be resized after creation).  
- Can store primitive data types or objects.  
- Efficient for iterating and data manipulation using loops.  
- Multi-dimensional arrays can represent tables or matrices (`int[][] matrix = new int[3][3];`).

Arrays are useful for storing structured data efficiently, but their fixed size can be limiting compared to dynamic structures like **ArrayList**.

---

### Q16. Define an Exception.

**Answer:**
An **exception** in Java is an **unexpected event or error** that occurs during program execution and disrupts the normal flow of instructions.  
Java provides a powerful **exception handling mechanism** to detect, manage, and recover from such conditions without terminating the program abruptly.  

**Hierarchy:**
All exceptions are subclasses of the **`Throwable`** class, divided into:
- **Checked Exceptions:** Checked at compile-time (e.g., `IOException`, `SQLException`).
- **Unchecked Exceptions:** Occur during runtime (e.g., `ArithmeticException`, `NullPointerException`).
- **Errors:** Serious issues beyond user control (e.g., `OutOfMemoryError`).

**Syntax Example:**
```java
try {
    int a = 5 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Division by zero not allowed!");
}
```

Exception handling improves program stability, readability, and ensures smooth execution even in the presence of errors.

### Q17. List the Advantages of Swing

**Answer:**
**Swing** is a part of Java’s **GUI toolkit** (`javax.swing` package) that builds upon AWT but offers **more advanced and flexible components**.  
It provides a rich set of **lightweight, platform-independent** GUI elements used for creating interactive applications.

**Major Advantages of Swing:**

1. **Platform Independent:**  
   Swing is written entirely in Java, so its appearance and behavior remain consistent across all operating systems.

2. **Lightweight Components:**  
   Unlike AWT, Swing components do not rely on native OS peers, making them faster and more customizable.

3. **Pluggable Look and Feel:**  
   Swing allows developers to change the UI theme dynamically using different look-and-feel options (e.g., Metal, Nimbus, Windows).

4. **MVC Architecture:**  
   Swing follows the **Model-View-Controller** pattern, separating data, interface, and logic for cleaner code design.

5. **Rich Component Set:**  
   Provides advanced controls like tables (`JTable`), trees (`JTree`), tabs (`JTabbedPane`), sliders, and more.

6. **Customizable and Extensible:**  
   Developers can easily extend existing Swing components or create new ones according to their needs.

7. **Event Handling and Thread Safety:**  
   Offers robust event-handling mechanisms and uses the **Event Dispatch Thread (EDT)** for smooth GUI updates.

**Example:**
```java
import javax.swing.*;
public class SwingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame f = new JFrame("Swing Demo");
        JButton b = new JButton("Click Me");
        f.add(b);
        f.setSize(300, 200);
        f.setVisible(true);
    }
}
```

In summary, Swing provides a **powerful, flexible, and consistent** framework for developing professional desktop applications in Java.

### Q18. Describe FilterStream

**Answer:**
A **FilterStream** in Java is a type of input or output stream that **filters data** as it is read from or written to another stream.  
It acts as a **wrapper around an existing stream**, modifying or enhancing its functionality without altering the original data source.  
Filter streams belong to the `java.io` package and are part of Java’s **decorator design pattern**, enabling stream chaining.

**Types of Filter Streams:**
1. **FilterInputStream:** Used for reading filtered data.  
   Examples: `BufferedInputStream`, `DataInputStream`, `PushbackInputStream`.  
2. **FilterOutputStream:** Used for writing filtered data.  
   Examples: `BufferedOutputStream`, `DataOutputStream`, `PrintStream`.

**Example:**
```java
FileInputStream fin = new FileInputStream("data.txt");
BufferedInputStream bin = new BufferedInputStream(fin);
int i;
while((i = bin.read()) != -1) {
    System.out.print((char)i);
}
bin.close();
```
Filter streams improve **efficiency, buffering, and data manipulation** while maintaining modularity and flexibility in I/O operations.

### Q19. What are the various features of a Menu?

**Answer:**
A **menu** in Java (part of the `java.awt` and `javax.swing` packages) is a GUI component that provides a **list of options or commands** for users to interact with.  
It enhances the usability and organization of graphical applications by grouping related commands together.

**Key Features of Menus:**
1. **Menu Bar (`MenuBar` / `JMenuBar`):** The container for menus displayed at the top of a window.  
2. **Menu (`Menu` / `JMenu`):** A drop-down list that holds menu items.  
3. **Menu Items (`MenuItem` / `JMenuItem`):** Individual selectable options in a menu.  
4. **Submenus:** Menus nested inside other menus for hierarchical structure.  
5. **Checkbox and Radio Menu Items:** Allow toggling options (`JCheckBoxMenuItem`, `JRadioButtonMenuItem`).  
6. **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Assigning key combinations to access menu items quickly using `setMnemonic()`.

**Example (Swing):**
```java
JMenuBar mb = new JMenuBar();
JMenu file = new JMenu("File");
file.add(new JMenuItem("Open"));
file.add(new JMenuItem("Exit"));
mb.add(file);
frame.setJMenuBar(mb);
```
Menus provide a **structured, user-friendly interface** for command selection in desktop applications.

### Q28. What is Double Buffering? What purpose does it serve?

**Answer:**
**Double buffering** is a graphical technique used to **prevent flickering** and provide **smooth animation** in GUI applications.  
In this technique, all drawing operations are first performed on an **off-screen buffer (memory)** instead of drawing directly on the screen.  
Once drawing is complete, the buffer is quickly copied to the display screen.

**Purpose and Benefits:**
- Eliminates flickering during frequent screen updates.  
- Provides smoother and faster rendering of graphics.  
- Improves overall visual performance in games, animations, and graphics-intensive apps.

**Example Concept:**
```java
public void paint(Graphics g) {
    Image offscreen = createImage(getWidth(), getHeight());
    Graphics buffer = offscreen.getGraphics();
    buffer.fillRect(0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight());
    g.drawImage(offscreen, 0, 0, this);
}
```

In summary, double buffering ensures **flicker-free rendering** by managing the drawing process efficiently between memory and display.

---

### Q29. What is an Interface? Explain with an example.

**Answer:**
An **interface** in Java is a **blueprint of a class** that contains **abstract methods (without body)** and **constants**.  
It is used to achieve **abstraction** and **multiple inheritance**, defining what a class should do but not how it does it.  
All methods in an interface are implicitly **public** and **abstract** (unless declared `default` or `static`).

**Syntax:**
```java
interface Animal {
    void sound();
}
class Dog implements Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Supports **multiple inheritance** (a class can implement multiple interfaces).  
- Promotes **loose coupling** between components.  
- Can include **default** and **static methods** (since Java 8).  
- Interfaces define a **contract** that implementing classes must follow.

Interfaces are essential for **designing modular, scalable, and testable** Java applications.

### Q20. List the three options of handling an event.

**Answer:**
In Java’s **event-handling mechanism** (based on the **delegation event model**), events are generated by components like buttons or menus and handled by **listeners**.  
There are **three main ways** to handle an event in Java GUI programming:

1. **Implementing Listener Interface in the Same Class:**  
   The component’s event-handling code is written in the same class that creates the component.  
   Example:
   ```java
   class MyFrame extends Frame implements ActionListener {
       public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { ... }
   }
   ```

2. **Using Separate Listener Class:**  
   A distinct class is created solely for handling events, improving code organization and reusability.

3. **Using Anonymous Inner Class:**  
   A short, inline class is used to handle the event directly where it occurs.  
   Example:
   ```java
   button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
       public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
           System.out.println("Button clicked!");
       }
   });
   ```

These methods provide flexibility in structuring event-handling code, balancing **simplicity, modularity, and maintainability**.

### Q1. Explain Control Structures in Java with an Example.

**Answer:**

In Java, **Control Structures** are fundamental building blocks that **determine the flow of program execution**.  
They allow a program to make **decisions**, **repeat operations**, and **control the order** in which statements are executed.  
Control structures enable programmers to implement **logical decision-making** and **iteration** effectively, enhancing both readability and efficiency.

---

## **Types of Control Structures in Java**

Control structures in Java are broadly classified into three main categories:

---

### **1. Sequential Control Structure**
- The simplest form of control structure.
- Statements are executed **in the exact order** in which they appear in the program.
- There is **no branching or looping** involved.

**Example:**
```java
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int sum = a + b;
System.out.println("Sum = " + sum);
```
Here, each statement is executed **sequentially**, from top to bottom.

---

### **2. Selection (Decision-Making) Control Structure**
These structures allow a program to **choose** between multiple paths of execution based on certain conditions.

#### (a) **if Statement**
Executes a block of code **only if** a condition is true.
```java
if (a > b) {
    System.out.println("a is greater than b");
}
```

#### (b) **if-else Statement**
Provides two alternative paths: one for **true** and another for **false**.
```java
if (a > b) {
    System.out.println("a is greater");
} else {
    System.out.println("b is greater");
}
```

#### (c) **if-else-if Ladder**
Used to test **multiple conditions** sequentially.
```java
if (marks >= 90)
    grade = "A";
else if (marks >= 75)
    grade = "B";
else if (marks >= 50)
    grade = "C";
else
    grade = "Fail";
```

#### (d) **Nested if Statement**
An **if statement inside another if**.
```java
if (a > 0) {
    if (b > 0)
        System.out.println("Both numbers are positive");
}
```

#### (e) **switch Statement**
Used when multiple conditions depend on a single variable or expression.  
It improves readability over multiple `if-else` statements.
```java
int day = 3;
switch (day) {
    case 1: System.out.println("Monday"); break;
    case 2: System.out.println("Tuesday"); break;
    case 3: System.out.println("Wednesday"); break;
    default: System.out.println("Invalid day");
}
```
**Note:** From Java 14 onward, enhanced `switch` expressions allow returning values directly.

---

### **3. Iteration (Looping) Control Structure**
Loops allow a block of code to **repeat multiple times** until a condition becomes false.

#### (a) **for Loop**
Used when the number of iterations is known in advance.
```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Count: " + i);
}
```

#### (b) **while Loop**
Used when the number of iterations is **not known** beforehand.  
The condition is checked **before** entering the loop.
```java
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    System.out.println("Hello");
    i++;
}
```

#### (c) **do-while Loop**
Similar to the `while` loop, but checks the condition **after** the loop body executes.  
Ensures that the loop executes at least once.
```java
int i = 1;
do {
    System.out.println("Number: " + i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);
```

#### (d) **Enhanced for Loop (for-each Loop)**
Introduced in Java 5 to iterate over arrays or collections.
```java
int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int n : nums) {
    System.out.println(n);
}
```

---

### **4. Jump (Branching) Control Statements**
These are used to **alter the normal sequence** of program execution.

1. **break:** Exits a loop or switch prematurely.  
   ```java
   for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
       if (i == 5) break;
       System.out.println(i);
   }
   ```

2. **continue:** Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.  
   ```java
   for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
       if (i == 3) continue;
       System.out.println(i);
   }
   ```

3. **return:** Exits from a method and optionally returns a value.

---

### **Real-Life Example: Combining Control Structures**
```java
public class ControlDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
        int sum = 0;

        for (int num : numbers) {
            if (num == 30)
                continue; // skip 30
            sum += num;
        }

        if (sum > 100)
            System.out.println("Sum is large: " + sum);
        else
            System.out.println("Sum is small: " + sum);
    }
}
```
**Output:**  
`Sum is large: 120`

### **Advantages of Using Control Structures**
- Improve **program logic and readability**.  
- Allow **decision-based execution** and **code reusability**.  
- Reduce redundant code by **automating repetitive tasks**.  
- Form the **foundation for algorithms and flow control** in software development.

---

### **Summary Table:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Sequential | Executes line by line | `int x = 10; System.out.println(x);` |
| Selection | Chooses a path | `if`, `if-else`, `switch` |
| Iteration | Repeats code | `for`, `while`, `do-while` |
| Jump | Alters flow | `break`, `continue`, `return` |

---

**In summary:**  
Control structures are the **core of Java programming logic**, allowing developers to build intelligent, flexible, and efficient applications by controlling how and when different parts of a program execute.

 ### Q2. What are the different forms of Inheritance? Does Java support all of them?

**Answer:**

**Inheritance** is one of the most important pillars of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java.  
It allows one class to **acquire the properties and behaviors (fields and methods)** of another class, enabling **code reusability, extensibility, and better maintainability**.

---

## **Definition:**

Inheritance is the process by which **one class (child/subclass/derived class)** derives the properties and methods of **another class (parent/superclass/base class)** using the `extends` keyword.

**Syntax:**
```java
class Parent {
    // parent class code
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // child class inherits properties and methods of Parent
}
```

---

## **Advantages of Inheritance**

1. **Code Reusability:**  
   Common logic can be defined once in the parent class and reused in child classes.

2. **Extensibility:**  
   Allows developers to extend existing classes without rewriting the entire code.

3. **Maintainability:**  
   Changes in the parent class automatically reflect in child classes, reducing redundancy.

4. **Polymorphism:**  
   Inheritance forms the foundation for polymorphism (method overriding).

## **Types (Forms) of Inheritance**

There are **five types of inheritance** that exist conceptually in OOP.  
Java supports **most**, but **not all** of them, for specific design reasons.

---

### **1. Single Inheritance**
- A subclass inherits from only one superclass.  
- This is the most basic and common form of inheritance in Java.

**Example:**
```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animals eat food");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.eat();   // inherited method
        d.bark();  // subclass method
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
Here, `Dog` inherits the property of `Animal` — showing a one-to-one relationship.

---

### **2. Multilevel Inheritance**
- In this type, a class is derived from another derived class.  
- The chain continues in levels (grandparent → parent → child).

**Example:**
```java
class Animal {
    void eat() { System.out.println("Eating..."); }
}

class Mammal extends Animal {
    void walk() { System.out.println("Walking..."); }
}

class Dog extends Mammal {
    void bark() { System.out.println("Barking..."); }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.eat();
        d.walk();
        d.bark();
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
Here, `Dog` inherits from `Mammal`, which inherits from `Animal`.  
All three levels share a relationship, demonstrating **hierarchical chaining**.

---

### **3. Hierarchical Inheritance**
- Multiple classes inherit from a single superclass.  
- Useful when several subclasses share common behavior but also define their own.

**Example:**
```java
class Animal {
    void eat() { System.out.println("Animals eat"); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() { System.out.println("Dog barks"); }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void meow() { System.out.println("Cat meows"); }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.eat(); d.bark();

        Cat c = new Cat();
        c.eat(); c.meow();
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
Both `Dog` and `Cat` inherit from `Animal`.  
This demonstrates **one parent and multiple children** relationship.

---

### **4. Multiple Inheritance**
- A class inherits features from **more than one parent class**.
- This form **exists in C++**, but **Java does not support multiple inheritance using classes** to avoid ambiguity known as the **Diamond Problem**.

**Example (Conceptual – not allowed in Java):**
```java
class A { void show() { System.out.println("Class A"); } }
class B { void show() { System.out.println("Class B"); } }
class C extends A, B { }  // ❌ Error in Java
```
**Reason:**  
If both `A` and `B` have a method `show()`, the compiler cannot decide which one to inherit — this is the **diamond ambiguity problem**.

---

### **5. Hybrid Inheritance**
- It is a **combination of two or more types** of inheritance (e.g., multiple + multilevel).
- Like multiple inheritance, **Java does not support hybrid inheritance using classes** directly due to ambiguity and complexity.

---

## **How Java Handles Multiple Inheritance**

While Java restricts multiple inheritance **with classes**, it **supports it through interfaces**.

**Example:**
```java
interface A {
    void display();
}

interface B {
    void display();
}

class C implements A, B {
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Display method implemented");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        C obj = new C();
        obj.display();
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
Here, `C` implements both interfaces `A` and `B`.  
There is no ambiguity because the subclass must provide its **own implementation** of the method.

---

## **Summary Table:**

| Type of Inheritance | Description | Supported in Java | Example |
|----------------------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| Single | One subclass inherits one superclass | ✅ Yes | `class B extends A` |
| Multilevel | Chain of inheritance | ✅ Yes | `class C extends B` |
| Hierarchical | Multiple subclasses from one superclass | ✅ Yes | `class B, C extends A` |
| Multiple | Inherit from multiple parents | ❌ No (classes) / ✅ Yes (interfaces) | `class C implements A, B` |
| Hybrid | Combination of inheritance types | ❌ No (classes) | Combination of above types |

---

## **Conclusion:**

Java supports **Single**, **Multilevel**, and **Hierarchical** inheritance through classes.  
However, to **avoid ambiguity and complexity**, it **does not support Multiple or Hybrid inheritance** using classes.  
Instead, Java provides **interfaces** to achieve multiple inheritance safely and efficiently, maintaining **clarity, simplicity, and robustness** in object-oriented design.
